movie-quiz-react-simple
Simple serverless react app that has two functionalities:
  1. Guessing movie by randomly selected image.
  2. Adding, updating and deleting movies for guessing quiz.

Idea for this app is from tutorial [React- Author Quiz](https://codepen.io/3point14/pen/KwEJwy/).

For easier startup, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is used.
